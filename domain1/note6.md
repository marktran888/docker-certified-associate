Convert an application deployment into a stack file using a YAML compose file with "docker stack deploy"
========================================================================================================

Stack commands:

```
docker stack deploy     Deploy a new stack or update an existing stack
docker stack ls         List stacks
docker stack ps         List the tasks in the stack
docker stack rm         Remove one or more stacks
docker stack services 	List the services in the stack
```

Create and update a stack from a compose or a dab file on the swarm. This command has to be run targeting a manager node.

The deploy command supports compose file version 3.0 and above.

```
$ docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml vossibility

```

The Compose file can also be provided as standard input with --compose-file -:
